# The-Legend-of-Zelda-intervention
 I worked on this game last year. Taking a little scope from an 80's game and giving it a twist was the task. A lot of new features were added to the Legend of Zelda (1986) game like NPCs that offer quests, new cool objects, secrets, and a more detailed flow.

To access the code: "Assets -> Scripts".
